# SiMinL_MiniProj5

# Requirements
Design a complex SQL query involving joins, aggregation, and sorting
Provide an explanation for what the query is doing and the expected results

# Purpose 
The goal of this project is to create an ETL-Query pipeline utilizing a cloud service like Databricks. This pipeline will involve tasks such as extracting data from FiveThirtyEight's public datasets, cleaning and transforming the data, then loading it into Databricks SQL Warehouse. Once the data is in place, complex queries like joining tables, aggregating data, and sorting results can be done. This will be accomplished by establishing a database connection to Databricks.


# Preparation
wait for container to be built and virtual environment to be activated with requirements.txt installed
make an .env file to store Databricks' connection 
extract: run make extract
transform and load: run make transform_load
